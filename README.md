# RSpec Testing

In this project, I have made test cases for all public methods inside my Tic Tac Toe classes; namely

1. tests in Player class
2. tests in Game class
I have defined all tests to output what is expected and also the errors to raise if not.

## Built
- Ruby

## How to run the tests

### RSpec install
1. Run `$ gem install rspec` in your terminal


### Running tests
1. To test methods in Player class run `$ rspec spec/player_spec.rb`
2. To test methods in Game class run `$ rspec spec/game_spec.rb`
